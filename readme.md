### Summary:

We will always do our best to fulfill your needs and meet your goals. This contract’s purpose is to ensure we both understand the terms of our cooperation and what happens if things go wrong. This plain English contract should hopefully help illustrate how seriously we take your safety, your satisfaction, and our quality of work without being too long-winded; we’re all busy people, right?

### Agreement:

We are an experienced and professional organization and we expect the same from you so that we may efficiently and effectively perform the services you need from us.

You agree to

- provide us with everything we need to complete the project in the format we ask for
- review our work, provide feedback and sign-off approval in a timely manner
- stick to deadlines we set together
- stick to the payment plan we agree on

We agree to

- meet deadlines, given you have adhered to the responsibilities above
- perform our services in a timely and professional manner
- say things you might not agree with to ensure your product is of the highest quality

### Details:

_Browser Compatibility Testing_

We agree to test our code in IE9+ as well as the latest releases of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

We will also test mobile Safari, mobile Chrome, and mobile Firefox on iOS devices and Android devices.

If you need browsers other than those listed, please provide us with a list of the browsers and devices. Testing additional browsers requires additional time to ensure compatibility.

_Development Practices_

If your employees or other contractors will be working on the project with us, we require that they write tests for all code they produce, and use Git to track all code as well.

_Hosting_

If we are developing your website or application, we require that the hosting solution used provides a VPS environment with full SSH access. If you don’t know what this means, be assured we will select the best hosting for your project so as to maximize reliability, minimize cost, and produce a better product overall.

_Additional Development_

Any additional development needed beyond what we have agreed to here must be accompanied by an additional contract which we will be happy to provide upon request. We retain the right to refuse additional work that is not specifically outlined in this document.

_Contact_

All communication will be made during regular business hours (M-F, 9am-5pm AKDT) excluding holidays. We agree to return any contact requests within one business day unless we notify you ahead of time that we will be unavailable. In the case of an emergency outside of our regular work time, our time will be billed at our priority rate.


We prefer all communication in a text-based medium, so that all of our correspondences are properly documented. However, we are happy to speak with you via Skype/Google Hangouts, over phone, or in person, keeping in mind that any decisions will be written down and require your written approval.

As we value your time as well as our own, we ask that all meetings be scheduled a minimum of two business days in advance and be accompanied by an agenda so that we can be fully prepared. If we are unable to attend a meeting at your suggested time, we will be happy to provide two times that will work for us. If you do not notify us of a meeting cancellation and you do not attend, you will still be billed for the time allotted.

_Project Management_

If you do not have a preferred project management tool, we will provide you with a login for ours where we will be able to see the status of the project.

To keep the project organized and the management of it easier, we prefer not to communicate using ordinary email.

### Legal Stuff:

Although we test extensively, we can't guarantee that the functions contained in any application will always be error-free and so we can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this application and any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Glad that’s over with…

### Copyrights:

You guarantee to us that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the application are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.

When we receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:

You own the graphics and other visual elements that we create for you for this project. We will give you a copy of all files and you should store them safely as we are not required to keep them or provide any native source files that we used in making them.

You also own text content, photographs and other data you provided, unless someone else owns them. We own the code we produced and we retain the rights to license it how we choose or to contribute it back to the open source project which it is based on.
We love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people, so we also reserve the right to display and link to your completed project as part of our portfolio and to write about the project on web sites, in magazine articles and in books as well as speak about them publicly at conferences. Of course we’re happy to keep this information to ourselves until your project goes live or six months from the handover date, whichever is sooner.

### Payments:

We are sure you understand how important it is that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly.  You also agree to stick tightly to the following payment schedule.
Payment Schedule
We bill every other week on Friday and all invoices are payable upon receipt.

Any payments not received within seven days will halt all work until the payment is received. If payment is late twice or more during the project, we retain the right to ask for prepayment for any remaining work under this contract.

### Contract Termination and Transfer:

If either party chooses to end the project, it must be done in writing. Please keep in mind that any deposit will be forfeited and all work that has been paid for will be turned over to you.

You cannot transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

This document is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of Alaska courts.
